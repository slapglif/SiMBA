---------
Implementation of:
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15360.pdf

This repository contains the code for the SiMBA (Simplified Mamba-based Architecture for Vision and Multivariate Time series), a transformer-based model that can process both visual and time series inputs.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

`coming soon...`

## Usage

To train the model, run the following command:

```
python train.py --config config.json
```

where `config.json` is the path to the configuration file.

To evaluate the trained model, run the following command:

```
python evaluate.py --model_path best_model.pth --data_path data/test.json
```

where `best_model.pth` is the path to the trained model and `data/test.json` is the path to the test data.

## Configuration

The configuration file is a JSON file that specifies the hyperparameters for the model. The following options are available:
`coming soon...`

## Data

`coming soon...`

## Evaluation

`coming soon...`
